# First Attempt to Implement [Midpoint Circle Algorith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_circle_algorithm) (2016, colorized)

Kinda crappy, but it does something. Rendering is done via [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/). The code stopped working in 2021, so we had to manually fix it, because something changed in the Rust compiler itself.

## Quick Start

```console
$ cargo run
```
