# Midpoint Circle Visualization Demo

Implementation of the [Midpoint Circle Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_circle_algorithm) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This was done in 2016 as a small research project on how to draw circles with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) since vanilla SDL2 does not allow you to do that. For that old implementation see the [2016-attempt](./2016-attempt/) folder.

In 2021 [@rexim](https://github.com/rexim) revisited this implementation on a [Tsoding](https://twitch.tv/tsoding) stream to see how much he improved as a programmer. See the [2021-attempt](./2021-attempt/) folder. Recording of the stream is available at `[TBD]`
